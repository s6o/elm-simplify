# elm-simplify demo

## development

To build and develop Elm demo application for gh-pages:

    * npm install
    * npm run watch

The resulting js/elm.js is a readable source build with debug information.

## deploy build

    * npm run build

The resulting js/elm.js will not include debug info and will be minified.
